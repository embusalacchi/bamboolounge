Hey! I'm Eric and I am a lifelong tinkerer with computers and technology. I decided to bring back a blog after leaving Twitter. Here you'll find information on the seemingly random projects I am working on.

If you're looking for the BBS I've been in the process of bringing it back from the dead on period correct hardware. You can track that progress and find the "Argus BBS Lifers Rulebook (v2.0)" [here](https://bamboolounge.com/bbs).
