# Bamboo Lounge on Blot

I have been looking to bring Bamboo Lounge back online from my Digital Ocean droplet to something a bit more flexible.  The main things I was looking for a way to post easily and Markdown support.  My goal was to be able to keep my notes for projects in Markdown (which I currently do) and easily put them on the web when ready.  After some research and trying other options I settled on [blot.im](https://blot.im) and so far it has been fantastic.  The developer was helpful with an early issue I ran into and "it just works".  Check it out if you're looking for an easy and nice looking site without the hassle! Test!
